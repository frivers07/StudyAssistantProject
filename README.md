# StudyAssistantProject
This project is using AI models and an arduino in order to help the user focus on studying. The python code will turn on your camera, allow you to set up a timer, and either give motivation messagages or sassy remarks depending on how focus you are on what you are studing. 

# Our Demos
For the first demo we did wanted to test our code to see if it will buzz whenever the person is looking away from the camera or looking at the camera.

For the second demo we were able to update the model to enable it to be more in tune with want we want for the final project, There was a timer and the model and the buzzer were fully syncronized at this point.
