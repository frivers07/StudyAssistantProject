# StudyAssistantProject
This project is using AI models and an arduino in order to help the user focus on studying. The python code will turn on your camera, allow you to set up a timer, and either give motivation messagages or sassy remarks depending on how focus you are on what you are studing. For the first demo we want to test our code to see if it will buzz whenever the person is looking away from the camera or looking at the camera.
